Learning Structures State Space Mechanisms

Interesting results on continuous data...
Can test on live bettting lines
BUT
ROBOT MOVEMENT MORE SAVAGE... Idk if I have to generate data
or the algo can learn from scratch. Might need to add an evaluator component

Evaluator will be good practice for redistubuting scores after X epochs
Idk how to do this prodecudarly... Can j have a black-box net that takes in state and "time alive" from start to that state. 
Seems pretty beginner tho

Can also run it on audio samples
Run over artists total discography
Run over Daily Dose total channel
Run over Audiobooks
